I’ve been meaning to share more of the small things I learn or create, but every time I sit down to write, I convince myself the topic isn’t "big" enough. I end up with half-finished drafts and nothing published.

So I’m trying something new. I’ve added a section to the site called "Tidbits". These are going to be short, focused posts—quick notes on things I’ve learned, gotchas I ran into, or patterns I find useful. Stuff that doesn’t need 1,000 words and a table of contents, but that I think others might find useful when they Google the same issue or topic.

The goal is to lower the bar for myself and actually hit publish more often. Hopefully some of these posts help you too.

I've already published the first one here: [ExUnit log_level macro](/tidbits/exunit-log-level-macro/)

You'll be able to see them all [here](/tidbits/) as I publish more.
